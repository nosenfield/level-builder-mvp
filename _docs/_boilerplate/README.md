# Boilerplate Templates

This directory contains template files used during project initialization. These are NOT project-specific content.

## Files

### project-prompt-template.md
The main initialization prompt used with Claude Code or Cursor to generate project-specific documentation and update the Memory Bank. Fill in the "Overview" section and reference your PRD to get started.

### task-tracker-template.md
Template for tracking implementation progress. Referenced by the project-prompt-template.md during initialization.

## Usage

These files are part of the boilerplate infrastructure and get copied to new projects. They are used during the initialization phase (Part 2 of the main README) but are not part of your project's active documentation.
